        <p>Many people choose to own a pet. One of the most common of pets to own is "man's best friend", a dog. Most of the people I know have bought a dog, however another option is to adopt one from a shelter. Many of the dogs in shelters have been through some kind of trauma and although not every dog in a shelter has been abused, abandonment can be considered as a traumatic exeprience also.</p>

        <p>Although it isn't common, neither is it rare for someone to adopt a dog. However, there usually aren't as many people willing to adopt a dog as there are dogs in a shelter. When you adopt a dog, not only dog you get a pet, but you are doing such a selfless thing by saving whichever dog you choose. Secondly, you have given your dog or puppy a family. This is one of the many reasons celebrities like Selena Gomez, Ryan Gosling, and many more have chosen to adopt.</p>
