        <p>Dogs are incredible animals. Taking care of a dog myself, I've learned how loving these animals can be. In my opinion, they are truly an animal that can be considered a best friend. Reason I say this is because of how strong their loyalty to their owner is. They also have incredible abilities, which allow for them to help us in ways we can't ourselves, such as: detecting when a persons bloodpressure goes down and when they are about to have a seizure. For those reasons and more, there are service dogs provided to people to do exactly that. There have been many cases in which a dog has saved their owners life and that is incredible.</p>
